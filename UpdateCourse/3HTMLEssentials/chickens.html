Chicken
<p>The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus), a subspecies of the red junglefowl, is a type of domesticated fowl. Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018,[1] up from more than 19 billion in 2011.[2] There are more chickens in the world than any other bird.[2] Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and, less commonly, as pets. Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4thâ€“2nd centuries BCE).

Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, 
Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[5] but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, 
the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian subcontinent. From ancient 
India, the chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th
century BCE.[6] Fowl have been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BCE, with 
the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from the land between Syria and Shinar,
Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.
